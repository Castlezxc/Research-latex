\section{Literature Review}

The impacts of water scarcity are likely to be extensive and universal since water is fundamental for life and directly or indirectly supports all economic activity. The consumption of water is increasing at a global rate more than two times greater than that for the population increase in the last century, and more regions are surpassing the limit at which water can be supplied sustainably \parencite{FAOwebsite}. Forecasts predict that two-thirds of the world's population will face water shortages by 2025. Although water scarcity is a reasonably new idea, its management will change policy-making for both rich and undeveloped nations \parencite{Guarino2015}.\\

The idea of scarcity is open to more than one interpretation and somewhat challenging to define as different policymakers, countries or institutions all have different perspectives on what defines a water shortage. Scarcity needs to be understood, firstly, as a relative concept. It is an imbalance between supply and demand that varies according to local conditions. Next, water scarcity is primarily dynamic as it intensifies with an increasing demand for water paired with the decreasing quantity and quality of the resource and these factors are continually changing as the economic environment within a region changes as well as a changing climate environment \parencite{FAOwebsite}.\\

SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; Southern California; Chennai, India; and Cape Town, South Africa are all recent examples of areas facing water crises which impacted local societies and economies significantly \parencite{CDP2015}. Water crises are ranked, based on likelihood and possible impacts, among the top global risks by the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 2019. Due to the global climate crisis, economic development and population growth, by 2030 the world's water withdrawals are predicted to exceed global renewable supplies by as much as 2,680 cubic kilometres annually \parencite{Strong2020}\\

The general negligence towards the management of water resources places society, businesses, and the environment under dire harm \parencite{CDP2017}. Freshwater availability has a volatile impact on GDP growth within countries, especially those in developing regions %cite Coping with the curse of freshwater variability. In regions where water was previously abundant, such as East Asia and Central Africa, water will become scarce unless those responsible take action. In already water-scarce regions such as the Middle East and the Sahel in Africa, the shortage of water supply will only increase. Water-related impacts on agriculture, health and incomes could see the GDP growth rates of these regions decline by as much as 6\% by 2050 \parencite{WB2016}. However, the World Bank has estimated that there is a need for more efficient allocation and policies around water resources to avoid this decline in regional GDP.\\ 

In 2015, companies and countries committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's), which asks member nations to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030 \parencite{SDG2015}. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, set out in the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations (%cite SDG's), provides a good point of reference when estimating the current state of water management and scarcity within a country. We will be looking to find a basic estimate of the current implication of the SDG 6 in South Africa and to possibly estimate which are the areas that this region should look to address first. The private sector has emulated country commitments to SDG 6 through increasing corporate commitment to water stewardship, which is: the use of water that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial, achieved through a stakeholder-inclusive process that involves and catchment-based actions \parencite{AWS2019}.\\
