Literature Review:

The impacts of water scarcity are likely to be extensive and universal, 
since water is fundamental for life and directly or indirectly supports all economic activity. 
The consumption of water is increasing at a global rate more than two times greater than that for population increase in the last century, 
and more regions are surpassing the limit at which water can be supplied sustainably \parencite{FAOwebsite}. 
Two-thirds of the world's population is expected to face water shortages by 2025. 
Although water scarcity is a fairly new idea it will change policy-making for both rich and undeveloped nations \parencite{Guarino2015}.\\

The idea of scarcity is open to more than one interpretation and rather difficult to define as it implies different dimensions or facets. 
Scarcity needs to be firstly understood as a relative concept, so an imbalance between supply and demand that varies according to local conditions. 
Next it must be understood, that water scarcity is primarily dynamic. 
Water scarcity intensifies with an increasing demand for water paired with the decreasing quantity and quality of the resource \parencite{FAOwebsite}.\\

SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; Southern California; Chennai, India; and Cape Town,
South Africa are all recent examples of areas facing water crises which impacted local societies and economies significantly \parencite{CDP2015}\\

Water Crises is ranked, based on likelihood and possible impacts, among the top global risks by the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 2019. 
Due to the global climate crisis, economic development and population growth, 
by 2030 the world's water withdrawals are predicted to exceed global renewable supplies by as much as 2,680 cubic kilometres annually \parencite{Strong2020}\\

The negligence placed on water resources places society, businesses, and the environment under dire harm \parencite{CDP2017}. 
Freshwater availability has a volatile impact on GDP growth within countries, especially those in developing regions. %cite Coping with the curse of
freshwater variability
In regions where water was previously abundant, such as East Asia and Central Africa, water will become scarce unless action is taken soon. 
In already water scarce regions such as the Middle East and the Sahel in Africa the shortage of water supply will only increase. 
Due to water-related impacts on agricultures, health and incomes, 
the GDP growth rates of these regions could decline by as much as 6\% by 2050 \parencite{WB2016}. 
However, the World Bank has estimated that the decline in regional GDP can be evaded through more efficient allocation and policies.\\ 
The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, set out in the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations %cite world sdg's,
 provides a good point of reference when estimating the current state of water management and scarcity that a country is facing.
We will be looking to find a basic estimate of the current implication of the SDG 6 in South Africa and to possibly estimate which are the areas that 
this region should look to address first.\\
In 2015, companies and countries committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) including SDG 6, 
which asks member nations to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all? by 2030 \parencite{SDG2015}.\\ 

The private sector has emulated country commitments to SDG 6 through increasing corporate commitment to water stewardship, which is: 
the use of water that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial,
 achieved through a stakeholder-inclusive process that involves and catchment-based actions \parencite{AWS2019}.\\
