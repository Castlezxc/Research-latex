\section{Introduction}

The introduction should provide a detailed description of the topic
and the aim of the research report. In addition the literature review
should intertwine with this. It is important to always reference where
needed. All work from somewhere else requires a reference \cite{Anguelov2010}.
QUESTIONS/POINTS TO COVER:

\section{Background Theory}

The theory of the topic should be thoroughly discussed in this section.
The student must show their proficiency on the topic as well as additional
insight. This section may be separated into a few sections as \textit{necessary}.
Note that the theory of the topic is the main contribution and the
report should illustrate this. 

\section{Model}

The application should be presented in this section. Code should
be included in an appendix as well as additional output if needed. 

\section{Conclusion}

The conclusion should summarise what was done in the research report.
It should also provide shortfalls of the research and recommendations
on what could be investigated in future. This section should be an
honest summary of the research.

\section{Recommendations}
