  abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the “dust bowl” era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

Using historical maize and cotton yield data from nine districts in Zimbabwe, we find that catastrophic drought insurance contracts based on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be constructed whose indemnities exhibit higher correlations with yield losses than the conventional rainfall index. In addition the NDVI contracts can be offered within the 5 to 10 per cent premium range considered reasonably affordable to many poor smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances in, and challenges for, weather index insurance for managing drought risk in smallholder agriculture, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its promise to integrate local agricultural risk smoothing with insurance principles, there remain many challenges to its mainstreaming in low income countries. Scaling up of weather index insurance pilot projects is particularly constrained by high-basis risk, related to the divergence between the calculated weather index and actual productivity loss on the farm. Various options may be considered to enhance uptake of weather index insurance. Linking reliable weather data with location-specific crop and agronomic conditions using flexible geospatial crop modeling tools is one option to reduce the basis risk. The other option is interlinking weather index insurance with credit or safety nets. In the end, insurance should be offered as part of a wider set of business services that provide real value to smallholders. Finally, the review acknowledges that the suggested conceptual solutions, especially interlinking index based weather insurance with credit will require more empirical evidence on the extent to which insurance would reduce the cost of borrowing and make credit more accessible to the smallholder farmers.},

  abstract = {Formal insurance contracts are rarely available for the small-scale agricultural and pastoral households who populate the often highly risky environments found in rural areas of low-income countries. Although a rich literature analyzes the wide array of informal social arrangements and diversification strategies that these households employ to manage risk, in nearly all cases these mechanisms are highly imperfect and in many cases carry very high implicit insurance premia. The net result is that risk contributes significantly to the level and persistence of rural poverty. In response to this challenge, a small, but growing number of projects are trying to fill this insurance void by developing index insurance contracts that offer payoffs based on the realization of an aggregate performance indicator, or index, rather than on individual-specific outcomes. Because it relies on an objectively and cost-effectively measured aggregate indicator - not manipulable by insured parties - index insurance is potentially viable in low-income agriculture, where transactions costs, moral hazard, and adverse selection typically cripple contracts based on individual-specific outcomes. Although index insurance principles thus seem to offer a way to reduce the costs of uninsured risk, most projects to date have insured stochastic income streams (e.g., crop yield insurance), despite the fact that globally most insurance sold is actually asset insurance. This article designs and implements a methodology for using satellitebased information to create asset insurance contracts for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet, namely, the pastoralist populations of the arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa.},

  abstract = {In the Sudano-Sahelian region, which includes South Niger, the inter-annual variability of the rainy season is high and irrigation is limited. As a consequence, bad rainy seasons have a massive impact on crop yield and regularly result in food crises. Traditional insurance policies based on crop damage assessment are not available because of asymmetric information and high transaction costs compared to the value of production. We assess the risk mitigation capacity of an alternative form of insurance which has been implemented at a large scale in India since 2003: insurance based on a weather index. We compare the efficiency of various weather indices to increase the expected utility of a representative risk-averse farmer. We show the importance of using plot-level yield data rather than village averages, which bias results due to the presence of idiosyncratic shocks. We also illustrate the need for out-of-sample estimations in order to avoid overfitting. Even with the appropriate index and assuming substantial risk aversion, we find a limited gain of implementing insurance, which roughly corresponds to, or slightly exceeds, the cost observed in India for implementing such insurance policies. However, when we separately treat the plots with and without fertilisers separately, we see that the benefit of insurance is slightly higher in the former case. This suggests that insurance policies may slightly increase the use of risk-increasing inputs such as fertilisers and improved cultivars, and hence improve average yields, which remain very low in the region.},

  abstract = {Although rainfall is a major indicator of the availability of water, temperature is also an important factor that can influence the availability of water as it controls the rates of evapotranspiration. Parameters such as rainfall and temperature can be used as indicators of drought. These indicators are converted to drought indices which show the different characteristics of a drought. This study compares two different drought indices in the Kafue Basin located in northern Zambia, where most of the socioeconomic livelihoods are dependent on water. The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) depends on precipitation as the single input variable while the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is derived from precipitation and temperature in the form of a simple water balance. By comparing time series plots (1960-2015) of the two indices, both indices were able to pick up temporal variation of droughts. SPI and SPEI agreed (R > 0.5) on the direction of change but the effect on the drought condition was different. Compared to SPI, SPEI identified more droughts in the severe to moderate categories, with extended duration and increased intensity. On the other hand, SPI identified more droughts than SPEI under the extreme category, but with a shorter duration and reduced frequency of occurrence compared to the severe to moderate droughts. The results suggest that temperature variability plays an important role in characterising droughts. SPI is useful in that it only requires rainfall as input and especially where temperature data is missing. However, the use of SPI to characterise drought should be done with caution.},

This method provides an efficient method for the space-time modelling of weather data as inputs to other agricultural, ecological and hydrological models used in weather impact assessments. The seasonal variation of the parameters of a point rainfall model, the Rectangular Pulses Poisson model, is represented by a quadratic polynomial spline. The coefficients of this representation are then spatially interpolated as functions of position as well as position and elevation. Thin plate smoothing splines are used in the interpolation procedure, and the methodology is tested with data from 102 stations in the Darling Downs region of South-East Queensland, Australia. Further testing with an independent data set demonstrates the adequacy of the technique in preserving historical statistics from the coefficients of the interpolated surfaces. A useful extension of this methodology to provide stochastic weather data for future climate scenarios is also discussed.},

A widely used version of ADW employs the correlation decay distance (CDD) to (1) select stations that should contribute to each grid-point estimate and (2) define the distance component of the station weights. We show, for Europe, that the CDD of daily precipitation varies spatially, as well as by season and synoptic state, and is also anisotropic. However, ADW interpolation using CDDs that varies spatially by season or synoptic state yield only small improvements in interpolation skill, relative to the use of a fixed CDD across the entire domain. If CDDs are optimized through cross validation, a larger improvement in interpolation skill is achieved. Improvements are larger for the determination of the state of precipitation (wet/dry) than for the magnitude. These or other attempts to improve interpolation skill appear to be fundamentally limited by the available station network. Copyright ? 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT This paper describes the construction of an updated gridded climate dataset (referred to as CRU TS3.10) from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world's land areas. Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way. This gridded product will be publicly available, including the input station series (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ and http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/). ? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},
