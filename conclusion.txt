\section{Conclusion}

There are many avenues to address water scarcity and, more broadly, climate change. There are several internationally
run funds that look to address general and specific aspects of climate change, from disaster relief to adopting new technologies.
Adequately addressing all aspects of climate change will require both public and private investment in climate infrastructure and
solutions. A report by the World Resource Institute  %cite achieving abundance attempts to put a dollar figure on the private sector investment that would be needed to meet the SDG 6 laid out in the United Nations' 2030 Agenda. These investments would go towards infrastructure to combat access and storage of water. Another report, by the World Bank, advises on the cost of addressing the various shortfalls in private water management %cite uncharted waters. A useful suggestion from this book is the use of tradable water rights that are in the form of standard contracts. This paper sees a unique opportunity in South Africa to adopt this due to the strength of our financial sector and systems. Another supply-side issue is the water dropped during transportation in water infrastructure, such as water pipes. South Africa loses around 90 billion Rand per annum due to leaks in this infrastructure %cite water resource group. Both the public sector and the private sector would need to implement these approaches to combat the adverse effects of climate change adequately.
