Conclusion:

There are a number of avenues to address water scarcity and, more broadly, cliamate change. There are several of internationally
run funds that look to address general and specific aspects of climate change, from disaster relief to adapting new technologies.
To adequately address all aspects of climate change will require both public and private investment in climate infrastucture and
solutions. %cite achieving abundance 
attempts to put a dollar figure on the private sector investment that would be needed to meet the SDG 6 laid out in the United Nations' 
2030 Agenda. These investments would go towards infrastructure to combat access and storage of water. %cite uncharted waters
speaks of the various shortfalls that could be addressed in public water management. A useful suggestion from this book is the use of water
rights that can be traded through standard contracts. This paper sees a unique opportunity in South Africa to adopt this due to the strength
of our financial sector and systems. Another supply side issue is the water dropped during transportation in water infrastructure, such as water
pipes. It is estimated that South Africa loses around 90 billion Rand per annum due to leaks in this infrastructure. %cite water resource group
Both of the public sector and private sector approaches would need to be implemented to adequately combat the negative effects of climate change.
