\section{Model}

\subsection{Research Methods}

The main aim of the model will be to provide some estimated answer as to the economic impacts of climate change on South Africa. This paper will focus on water scarcity as droughts and floods are the significant disaster risks that the Sub-Sarahan region faces %cite CRED.\\

Institutions often underestimated the impacts of and their exposure to droughts, as can be seen in the impacts of the recent drought that South Africa has experienced and the nature of droughts in general %cite uncharted waters. One of the main contributing components to a drought is the rainfall patterns within a region. Countries like South Africa rely on a rainy season in order to meet agricultural needs for food and animal feed. Volatile rainfall patterns, in combination with inappropriate water management systems, can lead to worrying levels of exposure to the negative impacts of drought. There have been several studies that have tried to use spatial analysis to capture the rainfall patterns in specific areas and globally and map out when droughts and particularly wet periods have passed. Most of these studies have used the Dellerware data to perform this analysis. This paper will not try to recreate these spatial models, but will rather accept their results and try to link these to economic impacts. The main factor that this paper will focus on as an indicator of the economic performance of a country will be Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\\ 

The model will analyse the correlations between different indicators of rainfall patterns, such as precipitation, to the overall GDP of a region over time. The model will have some calibrating periods where there have been known periods of droughts, such as recently in South Africa. The data for this study will come from the Delaware data set, the Demographic and Health Surveys Program run by USAID, the EARTHSTAT database, the World Bank World Development Indicators dataset and the United Nations World Population Prospects 2019 data set.\\

After establishing any correlations between drought indicators and economic indicators, the model will look to forecast these economic costs at least until 2030, based on the United Nations 2030 Agenda, under several different economic and climate scenarios. This scenario forecasting will require further research into the combinations of factors that would be appropriate to create feasible future scenarios.

\subsection{Possible Problems}

The possibility of insufficient data should not be an issue in the approach the model will take as all of the suggested datasets have data records over several decades. However, the data may be somewhat inappropriate, and issues around the granularity of the data may still exist. There may not be enough data to cover the rainfall in only one specific country as the data could be captured on a country by country level. However, this does not seem to be the case through a preliminary viewing of the data sets. Some other issues that the model will have to take into account will be the interference of other factors in the analysis of correlations. Examples of these external factors, external here referring to being outside of a drought or other factors of water scarcity, such as economic recessions. Further internal issues may arise in the analysis of rising temperatures and rainfall volatility as these two factors are closely linked and are both seasonal. %cite uncharted waters
