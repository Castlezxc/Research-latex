Background:

Climate change has been a topic of great interest in recent years: first with the Hyogo Framwork for Action, which was subsequently replaced by
the Sendai Framework for Action and finally the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. All of these reports, manuals and agreements have been
hosted and developed through the United Nations conferences. %cite the sendai framework and the hyogo framework documents. 
The general global consensus is that most natural disasters are worsened by the effects of climate change.  
The attention the topic receives is due to its serious impact on the environment and people, 
as well as the threat it poses to economic stability %cite the DRR report.\\ 

The effects of climate change are hard to quantify in general and especially hard to financially quantify. 
The tough task of calculating estimates as to how much investment is needed to combat climate change and
then where to invest it is under constant debate. There are a number of global funds with overlapping agendas that compete for 
money from the private and public sectors and who have overly complex systems that countries in need are asked to engage with to recieve funds. %cite fund paper
The difficulties are in seperating effects that can be attributed to climate change from general political and institutional mismanagement. In short,
deciding who is responsible for climate change is yet a further barrier to solving this international issue.
Despite this ther are some known effects that can be linked to climate change. Heatwaves lead to reduced productivity and disruptions in the workplace, 
while cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons cause serious devastation and leave millions of people in absolute poverty. 
The effects of most disasters are more serious in lower income countries as these negative effects are longer lasting and the relief
and aid availabe to people affected by disasters in these areas is minimal. %cite the GAR
Climate change is a currently pressing issue as our current agricultural and industrial practices are set to increase the relative costs associated with 
an increase in temperatures, increased volatility of natural water supplies and an increase in the number of natural disasters that the world 
is currently facing. %cite GAR (find out which chapter)
If we don't do something immediately, climate change could push 100 million more people into poverty by 2030, is the warning given by the World Bank. 
Droughts lead to serious water scarcity issues and diminish the world's food source, increasing the already complicated task of feeding the world population, 
which is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 \parencite{WPP2019}.\\

It is argued that climate change will have shocking consequences \parencite{Stern2007} 
while others only see climate change as a minor irritation \parencite{Mendelsohn2000}. 
However, there is no disputing that the twenty-first century will witness the impact of two irreversible movements: 
population growth and climate change. 

Within the broader field of climate change and all the real-world impacts it is estimated to have, water scarcity is one of the more pressing 
issues in the Sub-sarahan region. %cite four billion people 
With an increase in population growth in Africa, and in turn urbanization, comes an upturn in demand for water. 
These concerns are worsened due to the impacts of climate change creating increasingly uncertain rainfall patterns across the globe.\\ %cite uncharted waters
